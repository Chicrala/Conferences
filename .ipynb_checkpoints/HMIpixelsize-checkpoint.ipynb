    "<h1>Short note on the calculation of HMI pixel size</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook it will be discussed how you can calculate the size and area of each pixel. A short introdutory explanation for HMI coordinates is presented by <a href='http://sun.stanford.edu/~beck/JSOC/HMI_WCS_Dummies.pdf'>J.G. Beck (2010)</a>. A sample data is given\n",
    "\n",
    "From the <a href='http://jsoc.stanford.edu/doc/keywords/JSOC_Keywords_for_metadata.pdf'> JSOC Keywords for metadata (2013) </a> it is proposed for HMI that it should have a FIXED value for the radius of the Sun in meters combined with a measured average radius (pixels) of the solar image using a non-changing definition of the solar limb, combined with the known distance between the telescope and the solar center (not photosphere). The keywords “<TT>R_SUN</TT>”, “<TT>CRPIX1</TT>”, and “<TT>CRPIX2</TT>” will contain the key information from which the other values are computed. <TT>R_SUN</TT>, <TT>CRPIXj</TT> are all in pixels with center of the lower left pixel of the array set to 1.0, 1.0. The older MDI <TT>X0</TT> and <TT>Y0</TT> are the location of the solar disk center in the image and are $X0 = CRPIX1-1$ and $Y0 = CRPIX2 -1$. <TT>R_SUN</TT> is first determined in level1.0 processing so these keywords are absent prior to level1.0 data. They are included in the level-1 data only for reporting the measured quantities. They are not propagated to higher processing levels. From SDO altitude and orbit information it is defined that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <TT>DSUN_OBS</TT>: is the distance to Sun center from spacecraft in meters which is basically $1.5 \\times 10^{11} m$;\n",
    "- <TT>RSUN_REF</TT>: radius of Sun in meters, agreed upon standard ($6.96\\times10^{8}$ for HMI) but must be consistent with <TT>WAVELNTH</TT> keyword.\n",
    "- <TT>R_SUN</TT>: Sun radius computed from the same fit to each image (given in pixels);\n",
    "- <TT>IM_SCALE</TT>: it is computed from computed from <TT>R_SUN</TT>, <TT>RSUN_REF</TT> and <TT>IM_SCALE</TT> and given in arc-sec per CCD pixel value for the particular instrument. Note that <TT>IM_SCALE</TT> does not change when the image is rebinned on the ground. It is a characteristic of the data as observed. \n",
    "\n",
    "From HMI meta data we use <TT>CDELT</TT> which is the coordinate increment at reference point <b>IN ARCSEC</b> (see <a href='https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2002/45/aah3859.pdf'> Greisen and Calabretta 2002 </a>) to calculate the pixel size. For both AIA and HMI, lvl1.0 and above both <TT>CDELT1</TT> and <TT>CDELT2</TT> are equal to <TT>IM_SCALE</TT> which remains the plate scale of the original image value while <TT>CDELT1</TT> and <TT>CDELT2</TT> are set to be correct for a rescaled image.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we calculate the HMI pixel size using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$dx = \\frac{2\\pi\\cdot CDELT}{360} \\cdot R_{\\odot} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the first term represents the fraction of the angle covered by each pixel in the image which we then multiply by the solar radius. In Python we can calculate it using the following lines:"
